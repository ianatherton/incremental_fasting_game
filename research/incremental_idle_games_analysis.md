# Incremental and Idle Games: Genre Analysis and Innovation

## Introduction
Incremental and idle games (also known as clicker games) are a subgenre of casual games where players perform simple actions (like clicking) to earn in-game currency, which can be used to increase the rate of currency production. This report explores the evolution of the genre, notable games, and their unique innovations.

## Core Mechanics
- **Progression Through Repetition**: Players perform simple actions that generate resources
- **Prestige Systems**: Resetting progress for permanent bonuses
- **Automation**: Unlocking systems that play the game automatically
- **Exponential Growth**: Numbers grow extremely large over time
- **Minimal Active Play Required**: Many games can progress while closed
